You are analyzing a panel data set and what to determine if the cross-sectional units share a linear trend as well as any $I(1)$ or $I(0)$ dynamics? 

Conveniently test for the number and type of common factors in large nonstationary panels using the routine by Barigozzi & Trapani ([2022](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2021.1901719)).

## Installation

You can install the development version of BTtest from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Paul-Haimerl/BTtest")
```

After installation, attach the package as usual:

``` r
library(BTtest)
```

## Data

The `BTtest` packages includes a function that automatically simulates a panel with common nonstationary trends:

``` r
# Simulate a DGP containing a factor with a linear drift (r1 = 1, d1 = 1 -> drift = TRUE) and 
# I(1) process (d2 = 1 -> drift_I1 = TRUE), one zero-mean I(1) factor 
# (r2 = 1 -> r_I1 = 2; since drift_I1 = TRUE) and two zero-mean I(0) factors (r3 = 2 -> r_I0 = 2)
X <- sim_DGP(N = 100, n_Periods = 200, drift = TRUE, drift_I1 = TRUE, r_I1 = 2, r_I0 = 2)
```

For specifics on the DGP, I refer to Barigozzi & Trapani ([2022](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2021.1901719), sec. 5).

## The Barigozzi & Trapani ([2022](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2021.1901719)) test

To run the test, the user only needs to pass a $T \times N$ data matrix `X` and specify an upper limit on the number of factors (`r_max`), a significance level (`alpha`) and whether to use a less (`BT1 = TRUE`) or more conservative (`BT1 = FALSE`) eigenvalue scaling scheme:

``` r
BTtest(X = X, r_max = 10, alpha = 0.05, BT1 = TRUE)
```

Differences between `BT1 = TRUE/ FALSE`, where `BT1 = TRUE` tends to identify more factors compared to `BT1 = FALSE`, quickly vanish when the panel includes more than 200 time periods ([Barigozzi & Trapani 2022](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2021.1901719), sec. 5; [Trapani, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2017.1328359), sec. 3).

`BTtest` returns a vector indicating the existence of (i) a factor subject to a linear trend ($r_1$), the number of (ii) zero-mean $I(1)$ factors ($r_2$) and the number of (iii) zero-mean $I(0)$ factors ($r_3$). Note that only one factor with a linear trend can be identified.

## The Bai ([2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2003.10.022)) Integrated Information Criterion

An alternative way of estimating the total number of factors in a nonstationary panel are the Integrated Information Criteria by Bai ([2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2003.10.022)). The package also contains a function to easily evaluate this measure:

``` r
BaiIPC(X = X, r_max = 10)
```
